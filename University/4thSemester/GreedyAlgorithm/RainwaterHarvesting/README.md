# Water Trapping Problem

## Description

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, create a program to calculate how much water can be trapped after rain.

## Problem Statement

- The input consists of T test cases, where T represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N, the size of the array.
  - The second line contains N integers, each representing the height of a building.
