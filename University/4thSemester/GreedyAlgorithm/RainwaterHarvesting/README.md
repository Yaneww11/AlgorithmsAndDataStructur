# Water Trapping Problem

## Description

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, create a program to calculate how much water can be trapped after rain.

## Problem Statement

- The input consists of T test cases, where T represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N, the size of the array.
  - The second line contains N integers, each representing the height of a building.

## Example

Input:
3
6
0 1 0 2 1 0
4
3 0 0 2
5
0 3 0 2 0

Output:
1
4
2

## Output

- For each test case, print the maximum amount of water that can be trapped between the buildings.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code.
3. Run the executable.
4. Enter the input as described above.
